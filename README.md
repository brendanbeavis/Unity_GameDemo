# Game 'Pew'

## A small test demo I built as a first experience with Unity

## Description

A vampire surivivors-esq game, albeit at a very basic level. While there was provision for more enemies, upgrades, drops, etc, none more than one of each was implemented.
Probable I will never expand this game more than where it is now. I'd like to expand on this someday, albeit maybe starting fresh.

### Features

- Top down player movement
- Player collects drops to gain points/xp
- Player levels up with points milestones
- Enemies spwan on a set, but growing, rate with player
